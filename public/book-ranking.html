<h3>Commune Series</h3>

<p>But is survival worth the loss of humanity?<br />Finding a friend in the apocalypse isn't easy, 
and for Jake Martin, it's been damn-near impossible. Life has become an endless trek for canned 
food, shelter, and avoiding those who've turned to killing for anything all while trying not to 
become a killer himself.</p>
<p>When Jake encounters Billy, an elderly wanderer on the highway to ruined Las Vegas, everything 
changes. Billy reminds him of life before the world ended, of when being human meant acting like 
more than a mindless beast. Although their bond quickly grows, two men don't make a commune.</p>
<p>Together, they stumble upon a gang of scavengers keeping Amanda Contreras and her daughter 
prisoner, and using the mother to fulfill their base needs. Jake and Billy decide it’s time to 
stop just looking out for themselves.</p>
<p>After risking everything to break the girls free, their commune grows to four. Now, they must 
all learn to cooperate if they're to survive in a primitive, hostile world in search of a new 
home. Each of them will learn how far they're willing to go to continue living... or if living 
is even worth it.</p>
<p>At the end of the world, there is a commune called Jackson and this is their story.</p>

<h3>Hell Divers</h3>

<p>They dive so humanity survives…<br />
More than two centuries after World War III poisoned the planet, the final bastion of humanity 
lives on massive airships circling the globe in search of a habitable area to call home. Aging 
and outdated, most of the ships plummeted back to earth long ago. The only thing keeping the two 
surviving lifeboats in the sky are Hell Divers—men and women who risk their lives by skydiving to 
the surface to scavenge for parts the ships desperately need.</p>
<p>When one of the remaining airships is damaged in an electrical storm, a Hell Diver team is 
deployed to a hostile zone called Hades. But there’s something down there far worse than the 
mutated creatures discovered on dives in the past—something that threatens the fragile future 
of humanity.</p>

<h3>Expeditionary Force</h3>

<p>From Book 1: We were fighting on the wrong side, of a war we couldn't win. And that was the 
good news. The Ruhar hit us on Columbus Day. There we were, innocently drifting along the cosmos 
on our little blue marble, like the native Americans in 1492. Over the horizon come ships of a 
technologically advanced, aggressive culture, and BAM! There go the good old days, when humans 
only got killed by each other. So, Columbus Day. It fits. When the morning sky twinkled again, 
this time with Kristang starships jumping in to hammer the Ruhar, we thought we were saved. The 
UN Expeditionary Force hitched a ride on Kristang ships to fight the Ruhar, wherever our new allies 
thought we could be useful. So, I went from fighting with the US Army in Nigeria, to fighting in 
space. It was lies, all of it. We shouldn't even be fighting the Ruhar, they aren't our enemy, 
our allies are. I'd better start at the beginning....</p>
